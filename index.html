        <h1>2019 Forbes Global 2000</h1>
        <p>The Forbes Global 2000 is an annual ranking of the world's top 2000 best performing public companies by the Forbes magazine.
        <br>The ranking is determined using data in four metrics: revenue, profit, asset value and market value. The list has been published every year annually since 2003. </p>
        <p>While many people use this ranking list as an indication of the world's leading public companies and their performances, it is not definitive and is only an interpretation.
        <br>It should only be used as a general reference and not as an actual decisive evidence or data, since any changes to the criteria can change the ranking. </p>

            <h2>Sector and Industry of the companies</h2>
            <p>The Forbes Global 2000 list features public companies across all sectors, from classic giants like financials, industrials and materials, as well as newer up and rising sectors like information technology and consumer service sectors. Within each sector, there are multiple industries, and the featured companies are all categorised into a particular sector and industry within the sector. The visualisation on the right displays the number of 2019 Forbes Global 2000 company from each sector and industry.</p> 
            <p>Looking at the sectors, it can be noticed that the financial sector has the most featured companies on Forbes Global 2000 in 2019. In fact, this remains true for every individual continent as well. This is likely due to public companies generally pursues to maximise performance, which leads to many having generally better indicators like the ones used as criteria for the Forbes Global 2000 ranking. Another interesting observation is that in many continents, the industrials and materials sectors have the second or third most companies featured. Nevertheless, continents with a larger number of developed countries like Europe and North America, the consumer discretionary sector has more companies featured than the traditional sectors. </p>
            <p>Looking at the industries, the reason for why the financials sector has the most featured company can be seen, as the regional bank industry has a much larger number of Forbes Global 2000 companies than any other industries. A lot of companies from the investment services industry is also featured on the list, second most in all the industries. Both of these industries are part of the financials sector. An interesting observation in this visualisation is that the next industries with the highest count of featured companies are Oil and Gas Operations and Electric Utilities, from the energy and utilities sector, but none of these sectors are that high in count compared to other sectors. </p>

            <h2>Home Country of the companies</h2>
            <p>Just like for sectors and industries, the Forbes Global 2000 list also features public companies from all over the world, for every continent and many countries. This map visualisation on the left shows how many companies featured on the list in 2019 is located in each country around the world. If a country has no red dot on it, it means that country has no companies featured on the list. From the visualisation, it can be seen that only three countries around the world has over 100 featured companies. These countries are the United States of America, China and Japan, which makes sense as these countries are generally regarded as countries with strong business performance in the global stage. </p>
            <p>Using the market value slider, it can be seen that a lot of countries actually only contain featured companies with a market value below $100 billion USD. In fact, only 18 countries have featured companies with a market value. Amongst these countries, USA lead by having 55 of them, with China in second place, having 12 of them, while rest of the 16 countries all having less than 10. When market value is filtered to be larger than $200 billion USD, only 6 countries around the world remains, with USA having 27 featured, China having 5, Switzerland with 2, and South Korea, Taiwan and the Netherlands having 1 each. </p>
            <p>When filtering the map using sectors, some interesting observations can also be made. When filtering to the financials sector, another reason for why it is the sector with the largest number of featured company can be seen, as almost every countries with companies featured on the list has at least one company from the financial sector featured. Besides, when going through different sectors using the drop down menu, it can be seen that several countries have companies featured from almost every sector, these countries include the USA, Canada, a cluster of European countries, as well as Asian countries like China, India, South Korea and Japan. </p>

            <h2>Financial information of a company</h2>
            <p>As mentioned before, the ranking of the Forbes Global 2000 is based on 4 main criteria, profit, revenue, asset value and market value. 
            <br>A lot of times, these are the exact same information used for calculating financial indicators and performing fundamental analysis. 
            <br>Therefore, the following are some more in-depth looks into these financial information regarding the companies featured on the Forbes Global 2000 ranking in 2019. </p>

          <h2><center>Correlation between financial data</center></h2>
          <p style="font-size:23px">These bubble plots can be used to show the relationships between the revenue and profit of the companies featured on Forbes Global 2000 in 2019, and their market value. These companies’ asset value is also reflected with the size of each bubble, and the colours reflects which sector the company is a part of. </p>
          <p style="font-size:23px">Using the asset value filter, as well as the size of the bubbles, it can be noticed that that the companies with the largest asset value tends to be companies in the financial sector, and this is likely due to the nature of their business. Regarding the relationship between revenue and market value, the trend appears to be mostly linear, however, variance from the direct linear also increases along with the size of revenue and market value. Also, this linear relationship also seem weaker for sectors like health care, utilities, industrial, information technology and consumer staples. An interesting observation is that for the information technology sector, the linear trend is quite flat, meaning that these companies have a relatively smaller amount of revenue but still maintains a high market value. One exception to this is Amazon, which despite being from the consumer discretionary sector, exhibits a similar behaviour to the tech companies. This is likely due to its nature of being a predominantly online shopping platform. Another consumer discretionary sector company that acts as an outlier to the sector’s general trend, where it has a high market value despite lower revenue is Alibaba, and likely due to the same reason as Amazon.</p> 
          <p style="font-size:23px">Looking at the profit vs market value visualisation on the right, the problem with the increasing variance is much less serious, despite higher market value does generally mean higher profit. Also, unlike the revenue vs market value, the linear relationship and strength seem to be quite consistent across all sectors. Despite the strange behaviour for the information technology sector companies in the revenue vs market value plot, they behave less strangely for profit vs market value. Some interesting points are Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet. Despite their lower revenue, they actually have the highest profit, meaning that these tech-based companies actually have much less expense compared to other companies. </p>
          <p style="font-size:23px">One interesting point that’s common to both plots is the financial company, Berkshire Hathaway. This company appears to be an outlier to both plots, not having a very high revenue/profit, yet a very high market value. The reason for this is because this company’s CEO is Warren Buffett, a very significant figure in the financial sector, which boosts its market value. </p>

          <h2><center>Profit per dollar of asset and revenue</center></h2>
          <p style="font-size:30px">These two histograms shows the amount of profit the companies featured on Forbes Global 2000 list in 2019 earn per dollar of revenue and asset. The profit per asset/revenue values are binned into 0.075 steps for profit per revenue and 0.02 steps for profit per asset, and the number of companies are counted, the mean profit per revenue/asset value of all the companies are also shown. When considering the overall counts, excluding the certain few outliers, the histograms appear to be positively skewed, profit per revenue having its peak at between 0.025 and 0.05, as well as profit per asset having its peak at between 0.005 and 0.015, and the count getting smaller and smaller as the amount of profit per dollar of asset/revenue increases. In fact, for both visualisations, this positively skewed shape of the histogram tends to remain consistent for every continent. </p> 
          <p style="font-size:30px">Nevertheless, when using the sector drop down menu filter, the positively skewed shape of the histograms are not as apparent. For the profit per dollar of revenue histogram, while most sectors maintain the relatively positively skewed shape, certain sectors produces a shape more balance, with a shape closer to the Gaussian distribution (normal distribution). For the profit per dollar of asset histogram, this situation is even more obvious. While the overall histogram’s shape is positively skewed, when looking at individual sectors, most show a balanced shape like the Gaussian distribution and some, like health care, information technology and telecommunication services even shown a relatively odd bimodal distribution, with two main peaks. </p>
